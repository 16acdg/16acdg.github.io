# 16acdg.github.io

## Portfolio site for some of my projects, access to my contacts, resume, etc.

Using github pages to host a static site where you can find some of my projects, my resume, my contact information, and more. Utilizing github pages for each indiviudal repository too, so when you navigate to a project in my website, you get the index.html file that is kept in the project's repo.

The data for my readinglist is fetched from a readonly endpoint I set up on heroku, which in turn fetches the data from goodreads.
